# HurstExponent
The Hurst exponent is a measure of the long-term memory of a time series. It quantifies the tendency of a time series to revert to its mean or cluster in one direction. The Hurst exponent shows if a time series behaves in a random, trending, or mean-reverting way. It captures the speed autocorrelation decrease as the lag increases.
